# Developer containers

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Beginner", "IDE", "Tutorial"]} />

## Overview

Developer containers are a local development option that uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to run local containerized environments. Developer containers are a good option for developers on Windows systems, since `dfx` is not natively supported for local development on Windows.  

## Using developer containers

To use developer containers, you must download [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Then, you can open a GitHub repo in the container using a URL such as:

```
https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=[GITHUB_URL]
```

For example, to open the ICP Hello World Motoko example, open the URL:

```
https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/dfinity/icp-hello-world-motoko
```

When prompted, select 'Open Visual Studio Code'. 

Upon opening in VS Code, you will be prompted to install the required plugins to use the developer containers feature.
